                                TO DO LIST FOR OUR PROJECT :

IMPORTANT STUFF :


1 - Display_message_method (estimated difficulty : hard)
- must display messages under the FPS
- Grey semi-transparent background as for tooltips to make messages easier to read
- "messages" fade after a few seconds of inactivity
- a new message appears above the previous one
- Old ones get deleted when reaching max_messages limit

2 - Add gold, berry bush resources (easy)

3 - Add water tile (easy)
- Map should be surrounded by water
- Add water inside the map (harder)
- Water has collision

4 - Starting menu (medium)
- IS IT FINISHED ?
- Must be able to load a game
- Must be able to start a game and specify : the size of the map (50x50, 100x100, etc...), the starting resources for player, the civilization (only the standard one for us)

5 - In-game menu (medium)
- Display centered in game menu with "PAUSE", "OPTIONS", "SAVE", "LOAD", "QUIT"
- Pause OPTIONAL FOR NOW
- OPTIONS : nothing for now, maybe one or two random case you can check for later
- SAVE : see 11
- LOAD : same
- QUIT : go back to main menu after asking "are you sure you want to quit this game ?"

6 - Win/Lose menu (medium)
- When we lose/win a game, should display a big "WIN" or "LOSE" message
- Continue / QUIT buttons if you win
- Quit if you lose
- Display score screen when you QUIT, and go back to main menu after quitting SCORE screen

7 - Update the way collision is managed in our code (easy)
- We should only work with the collision matrix now and remove all the redundant stuff (don't forget the collision matrix uses inversed x and y)

8 - Properly implement attack method (medium-hard)
- a unit attacks another one when right-clicking on a enemy unit. If not in range, get close enough to do. If its not possible, do nothing and display message : "Cant reach target ?"
- maybe use remove_entity method to remove units/buildings when they die
- display health bars of attacked units
- make sure they attack xxx times per sec (see attack_speed for units)
- implement projectile system for ranged units

9 - Properly implement gather resource method (medium-hard)
- villagers must gather x amount of resources, and go back to towncenter to give it to the player
- villagers shouldn't stop gathering once they destroyed a tree/rock
- put gather stuff inside a method to make it clearer

10 - Properly implement build method (medium) - WORK IN PROGRESS TRISTAN
- villagers must move to an adjacent tile before starting the creation of the building, and construction must stop if the villager stop working on it
- must be able to cancel a building creation (Optional)

11 - Save/Load method (Hard)
- will probably force us to properly separate display and objects

12 - Town center selection - Tristan : DONE
- we must be able to select town center when left clicking on all 4 tiles, not only the bottom left one


15 - Town center spawn :
- spawn in a corner. Remove trees/stuff around it.
